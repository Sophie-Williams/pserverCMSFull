## PServerCMS basic configuration

 Go to the `config/autoload` directory and create `[GAME].local.php` with the content of `[GAME].example.php`. Now you have to edit the 
 configuration with the sql connectÂ´s and other parts like mail and and and, you can find some other parts in [PServerCMS-Config](https://github.com/kokspflanze/PServerCore/blob/master/config/module.config.php)
 
 PS: You have to create the web-database by your self, the scripts of the p-server-cms will just add the tables, but will not create the database.
 
 For other games you can also use the `*.example.php`, but you have to change `gamebackend_dataservice`, if you only want to test you can
  use the Mocking-Class.
